## Teaching advice from ChatGPT roleplaying as a senior developer
As a senior developer, I believe that becoming a better Unity teacher requires a combination of technical and soft skills. Here are a few tips that can help you improve your Unity teaching skills:

Master the fundamentals of Unity: Before teaching others, ensure that you have a strong grasp of the fundamentals of Unity. This includes knowledge of the Unity interface, scripting languages, and game development concepts.

Create engaging content: Use real-world examples and create interactive content that helps your students to learn Unity in a fun and engaging way. This could include creating mini-games, tutorials, or demos that demonstrate key Unity concepts.

Provide opportunities for hands-on learning: Incorporating hands-on learning opportunities can help to reinforce the information you are presenting and make it more memorable. Encourage your students to work on projects that challenge them and push them to explore new areas of Unity.

Use a variety of teaching methods: Some students learn best through lectures, while others prefer hands-on learning or group activities. Use a variety of teaching methods to cater to different learning styles and keep your students engaged.

Encourage questions and provide feedback: Encourage your students to ask questions and provide regular feedback to help them improve. This can help to identify areas where your students need additional support and help you to adjust your teaching approach accordingly.

Keep up with the latest trends and technology: The world of Unity is constantly evolving, so it's important to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technology. Attend conferences, read blogs, and join online communities to stay current with the latest Unity developments.

Remember, becoming a better Unity teacher is a continuous process that requires ongoing effort and improvement. By incorporating these tips, you can become a more effective and engaging Unity teacher.

## Comment from Leon
There is a lot of truth to this, at least from my experience studying Unity at college and learning more about it at work. Especially, the visuals and interactive parts of lessons were helpful for me. One thing that I am missing from this list is Unity troubleshooting: Unity is software which sometimes has odd error messages (e.g. the Android build SDKs not being found even though they clearly exist) and this troubleshooting process should be taught to students because they will need those skills daily, regardless of Unity or no-Unity.
