title: "Breaking into the German Games Industry"

This less-technical post is about how to find work as a Unity Developer in the German games industry. I have been working in the German games industry for 2-3 years so the idea of breaking into it still feels recent.

## Porfolio
**Game Jams (short term)**

Game jams are a great way to practice Unity and to meet new people. https://itch.io/jams is a great place to look for jams happening whenever.

**University Projects**

Many university programs in Germany (like [Animation & Game in Dieburg](https://ag.mediencampus.h-da.de/)) ask students to finish some smaller projects each year. This is a good way to try new engines, meet new people, and practice fixing problems and making new content under time-pressure.

**Side Projects**

My personal favorite right now is Weekend Projects (some people call them side projects). This is a good way to practice programming language with little risk and often-times these projects are quickly thrown away. Working on side projects with friends is a good way to stay motivated for a longer time as well as to have a second pair of eyes, sometimes this organgically encourages code review.

## Your social network
Your social network makes it easier to find work. Many work opportunities I had in the games industry were with companies I heard about through friends. Conventions are a good way to gain cold-pitching and smalltalk experience. Meeting up with friends is a good way to share experiences about work culture, salary, and career goals.

Even talking to complete strangers may help you make a games conection. I once made a colleague because I talked to the stranger across from me and asked him if he was studying games (he was making small sketches in his sketchbook that reminded me of the 3D program Maya). That stranger later recommended a man who would become a backend developer for a company I was working at (and backend mentor!).

Maintaining a LinkedIn profile is a good way to increase your exposure to other companies. I have been told that some companies also take a look at your profile to learn more about your personality so try keep your profile up to date and presentable.
  
## Improving your chances
**The big city**

Many bigger game studios in Germany are located in the bigger cities. Games Wirtschaft has an [article](https://www.gameswirtschaft.de/wirtschaft/groesste-games-entwickler-studios-2019/) showcasing this. Cities like Hamburg and Berlin are mentioned multiple times. You may also find a good studio in a small village but keep in mind that many game companies in Germany seem to gravitate towards cities.

Of coures many positions are also remote. Try to request this early in the process but not too early. During the first interview might be a good time to ask a neutral question like "Does [company name] offer remote working?"

**Non Unity-Games Jobs**

Many companies like Thyssenkrupp in Kiel may also be looking for Unity developers even though they make submarines which are not the same as your mom's favorite mobile game. It may still be a good way to gather Unity experience until you find your dream job because much of the day-to-day problem-solving and jira-marking-as-done tasks may still be the same.

Before working as developer I worked as a game design intern at Deck13 Interactive GmbH. Deck13 worked in their own engine at that time so it was very different than working in Unity. However, I was still able to learn a lot and this internship will remain on my CV until I die which also makes it easier to find work in the future.

**Your CV**

Keep your CV up to date and focus on your technical experience. During an interview is a good time to present yourself as a human but up to that point I have a pretty strong suspicion that HR is looking for someone that is a good general fit: if you are a Unity developer write that on your resume, this will make you more suitable for Unity roles.

## Special Mention
I have recently started working at InnoGames GmbH and can recommend it to any/all Unity developers who are looking for work in Europe! Let me know if you are looking for a recommendation.

Also if you are looking for a CV review or want to take part of a game jam together, let me know, I'm here to help!
